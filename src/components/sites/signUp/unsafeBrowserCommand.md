To test Loops in Dev mode either use Brave with "Shields down" or use this Chrome with this flag:
For Windows:

"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --user-data-dir="C://Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security

!!! IMPORTANT:

!!! (1) Run this without any instances of chrome running already. It should be the first chrome window being opened.

!!! (2) You might need to change chrome.exe directory based on where it is on your machine.
